              <b>The Perfect Red Velvet</b> is the repackage of Perfect Velvet, the second studio album of South Korean girl group Red Velvet, which was released in November 2017.
              The reissue was released on January 29, 2018 by SM Entertainment with the lead single "Bad Boy" which was produced by American production team The Stereotypes, who previously worked with the group on a song from the original album.
              The album also contains two new tracks, which incorporate R&B and retro disco styles along with all the tracks from Perfect Velvet.
              Critics praised the group for portraying powerful women and attempting a sexy concept for the first time since their debut for "Bad Boy".
              They also complimented the songs added to the album for their retro vibe.
              Billboard referenced the group's dual concept and called the album and the single "overall representatives" of their "velvet" side. In December 2018, the "Bad Boy" was included in Billboard's 100 Best Songs of 2018: Critics' Picks while The Perfect Red Velvet was one of Refinery29's 12 Best K-Pop Albums of 2018.
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>The album topped South Korea's Gaon Album Chart and "Bad Boy" debuted at No. 2 on Gaon's Digital Chart. The Perfect Red Velvet also charted at No. 3 on Billboard's World Albums Chart while "Bad Boy" peaked at No. 2 on its World Digital Songs chart.
              "Bad Boy" also became the group's first release to chart on the Canadian Hot 100.

            <p>
              <br>Only two months after the release of the group's second studio album Perfect Velvet, which became their most successful album to date, S.M. Entertainment announced through an image teaser posted on their official Twitter and Instagram accounts on January 23, 2018 that Red Velvet will be releasing a repackage of the album titled The Perfect Red Velvet with "Bad Boy" as its lead single.
              "Bad Boy" was described as a song with a "sexy" or "girl crush" concept by South Korean news sites, which has never been done before by the group. On January 24, 2018, it was reported that the repackage of Perfect Velvet will be released on January 29 with three new songs, including "Bad Boy".
              On January 26, individual teasers of members Wendy and Joy were released through the group's official SNS accounts which were noted by Kang Seo-jung of Osen as having the vibe of a powerful "eonni". In the same article, Kang also spoke of how their latest concept differs from the group's past releases. These teasers were followed by clips of Irene and Yeri on the following day, with Seulgi's being released on January 28.

            <p>
              <br>With all of the tracks from Perfect Velvet, the repackage was released with three new songs with a total of twelve tracks.
              The album's lead single "Bad Boy" is characterized as an R&B song with elements of hip hop and a synth melody along with a heavy bass sound. In an interview with Idolator on January 16, 2018 about being nominated at the Grammy awards and working with K-pop artists, American production team The Stereotypes revealed they had "a new one coming that's gonna be really cool" when asked about working with Red Velvet.
              Previously, they also produced two tracks from Perfect Velvet ("Kingdom Come" and "Attaboy"). It was eventually reported that the new song will be the album's lead single "Bad Boy".[7] The song was composed by The Stereotypes, Maxx Song and Whitney Philips with Korean lyrics by Yoo Young-jin, and the lyrics describe the attraction between bad men and arrogant women. Mexican news site Milenio called the song's melody a mix of R&B and hip hop, and described its lyrics as the story of the beginning of a couple's relationship.
              <br>
              <br>"All Right" is an up-tempo dance-pop song that lyrically encourages a person to look forward to the future with the people around them. Composed by Kevin Charge, Phoebus Tassopoulus and Jessica Jean Pfeiffer, its lyrics were written by Lee Seu-ran of Jam Factory. "Time to Love" is a mid-tempo R&B ballad composed by Ellen Berg Tollbom, Ming Ji-syeon and Lee Dong-hoon with lyrics written by Kim Eun-jung detailing excitement over a new relationship.[10]
              On iTunes and Apple Music, the reissue was released as a five-track EP with no tracks from Perfect Velvet, but instead featuring the instrumental versions of "Bad Boy" and "Peek-a-Boo" along with the new tracks "Bad Boy", "All Right" and "Time to Love".

              <br>The album's title track "Bad Boy" had what Annie Martin of UPI called a "sultry" music video that featured the members in various coordinating outfits, which include all-black ensembles and pink pajamas, while performing against a snowy backdrop.
              The song was choreographed by Japanese hip hop dancer and choreographer Rie Hata, who had previously worked with CL for the choreography of "The Baddest Female" and with the group's label mate BoA for her single "Nega Dola".
              <br>Red Velvet held a comeback showcase on January 29, 2018, the same day as the album's release, and was hosted by label mate Girls' Generation member Hyoyeon. It was broadcast live through the Naver app V-Live. During the show, the members discussed their new songs, including "Bad Boy" which they performed live for the first time. The group started their music show promotions through M! Countdown on February 1.
              The group also performed the song on Music Bank, Show! Music Core, Inkigayo and Show Champion where they won their first trophy for "Bad Boy" on February 7.
              To further promote the album and single, the members also appeared on several radio shows in South Korea such as SBS FM's Choi Hwa Jung Power Time, SBS' NCT's Night Night and SBS FM's Kim Chang Ryul's Old School Radio.
              On February 28, 2018, Red Velvet released the music video for "I Just".

              <br>Tamar Herman of Billboard called the title track "Bad Boy" their "darkest yet", comparing them to the rainbow hues of their last single "Peek-a-Boo" and stated the members "played up their smoother retro leanings" with the addition of the new songs. Herman also commented on the members' styling, noting the "sexy uniforms and athleisure fishnet-and-leather outfits" which depicted the group as "femme fatales".
              The song's choreography was also seen as the sexiest the group has ever done. Lastly, she called the song and the album "overall representatives" of the group's "velvet" side (a reference to the group's dual concept), contrasting the quirkier "red" songs the group has released in the previous year.
              Similarly, Ela Teodosio of Christian Today believed that the single was their "most fiery track yet" and stated that the two other tracks that were added to the album "follow the group's theme of retro disco".
              <br>
              <br>Avery Thompson of Hollywood Life called the members "the epitome of girl power" as she praised the music video of the lead single.
              Fuse's Jeff Benjamin opined that the group put their own spin on modern R&B and hip hop, comparing it to the likes of Rihanna, Tinashe, and Cardi B where they incorporate "sassy, catch phrases into their verses and choruses".
              He then described the other track "All Right" as a "synth-pop cut" and "Time to Love" a "snappy ballad".[22] Forbes stated that The Stereotypes' work on the album "have helped hone the girl group's lush contemporary R&B-meets-pop sound". In December 2018, Billboard included the title track "Bad Boy" in their '100 Best Songs of 2018: Critics' Picks' list while MTV picked "All Right" as one of the 'Best K-Pop B-Sides of 2018'.[24][25] The Perfect Red Velvet was also included in Refinery29's '12 Best K-Pop Albums of 2018'.
              In South Korea, X Sports News called "Bad Boy" the perfect blend of the group's intense "red" side and soft "velvet" in their review of Red Velvet's dual concept "red" and velvet" since their debut with "Happiness" and "Be Natural".

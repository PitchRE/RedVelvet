               <b> RBB</b> is the fifth Korean extended play (eighth overall) by South Korean girl group Red Velvet.
                 It was released on November 30, 2018 by SM Entertainment, with the lead single "RBB (Really Bad Boy)" and five other songs including an English version of the title track.
                 The album was a commercial success overseas, with RBB and its lead single debuting atop Billboard's Top Heatseekers Album chart and World Digital Songs chart for the first time.
                  The EP became the group's fourth consecutive album to earn a new best sales week in the United States.
                  RBB also charted in France, Japan and the United Kingdom. It received generally positive reviews from critics who praised all of the album's tracks, with Caitlin Kelley of Forbes noting that all of the songs on the album "are strong enough to stand on their own".

                <br>
                <br>Conversely, "RBB (Really Bad Boy)" received mixed reactions from the public in South Korea.
                 Despite this, the song peaked at number 10 on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart and at number 5 on the Gaon Download Chart.
                 Its parent album also debuted at number 3 on the Weekly Gaon Album Chart upon its release and charted at number 8 on the Monthly Gaon Album Chart with only a day to garner points to enter it.

                <br>In August 2018, SM Entertainment has revealed their artist comeback plan for the second half of the year, with Red Velvet revealing to have two more album releases, the other titled Summer Magic.
                 After Summer Magic's release, news about Red Velvet's upcoming comeback circulated in October 2018, which the group's label SM Entertainment confirmed that Red Velvet would return in November with a new album but clarified that there was no set schedule.
                  On November 9, 2018, SM Entertainment revealed the details of the EP along with the title of the lead single, "RBB (Really Bad Boy)", and the release date.
                 During a V Live broadcast, member Yeri stated that the preparation for the album was longer than their other title tracks.
                  The album was released on November 30 and marketed as their fifth Korean EP but seventh Korean EP overall, since two were marketed as special summer releases.
                Member Yeri stated they were also doing concerts amidst preparations for the album, which put them on a really tight schedule.

                <br>The lead single "RBB (Really Bad Boy)" was characterized as an R&B pop dance track with a catchy melody.
                 The song was written and composed by SM Entertainment songwriter Kenzie and co-composed by Timothy 'Bos' Bullock, Sara Forsberg, MZMC with arrangement by Bullock. Lyrically, it expresses the charms of a "bad boy".
                <br>
                <br>The second song "Butterflies" was described as a punk-pop track, its lyrics comparing the sensation of falling in love to a butterfly dancing.
                 "So Good" was characterized as a future bass track with an R&B base that features a piano melody and rhythmical drums in the instrumental. 
                 "Sassy Me" is an urban pop dance track that ranges from low to high notes that allow the group to show off their vocal abi
                 "Taste" is an old-school dance-pop song with lyrics that talk about the choices a person makes and not listening to others' opinions, following their heart instead.
                  It features a narration written by member Wendy.

                <br>To promote the album, Red Velvet held a V Live broadcast on November 29, the night before its release.
                 The group had their "comeback stage" for RBB on the music program Music Bank, performing both the title track "RBB (Really Bad Boy)" and "Butterflies" live for the first time and an hour before the album's official release.
                 This was followed by performances on Show! Music Core and Inkigayo.


                <br>An accompanying music video for "RBB (Really Bad Boy)" with choreography by Choi Sun Hee, Kaycee Rice and Janelle Ginestra was released on the day of the album's release.
                 The Halloween-themed video, which had a "Howliwood" sign in the background (a parody of "Hollywood") featured the titular "bad boy" in the song in the form of a werewolf who chases after the girls throughout the video, moving from various retro-inspired sets such as a pink room with a checker-patterned floor, a pumpkin patch with the sign behind it, and the girls stuck inside picture frames.
                 The music video also references the 1980 film The Shining in a scene where members Irene and Yeri are dressed up as the Grady twins. Forbes called the music video "B-movie schlock retrofitted to K-pop perfectionism".

                <br>Internationally, RBB received generally positive reviews from critics. Natalie Morin of Refinery29 opined that while their last album Summer Magic was "an expression of their bright, fun "red" side, RBB highlights their soft, sultry "velvet" side".
                 She added that the EP acted as "a sequel to their January mega-hit 'Bad Boy'". She also said the group "has a penchant for high drama, and the video for "RBB (Really Bad Boy)" plays right into it. Set in a retro "Howliwood" movie set — imagine being so powerful that you bring back Halloween on the cusp of winter".
                  Mike Nied of Idolator described the title track as "a fiercely danceable production" and that "it is built around a sing-along chorus. 'Oh my god, he's a really bad boy'". He then singled out "Sassy Me" as his favorite song from the album, highlighting the track's "horn-heavy stylings". He then talked about "RBB (Really Bad Boy)"'s music video and said it "boasted dramatic set pieces and incredible choreography".
                   Brooke Bajgrowicz of Billboard noted that the music video had a "fun, creepy aesthetic" and described all of the album's songs as "harmony-heavy, electropop tracks".
                 Chase McMullen of The 405 talked about the various unique concepts the group has done in the past and stated that "Like it or not, Red Velvet are quite simply the most idiosyncratic and joyous pop group from any country working today". 
                 He also praised "RBB (Really Bad Boy)", saying it "ups the ante on boisterous, feminist fun" from "Bad Boy", but "in true Red Velvet fashion, it is surpassed by RBB's deep cuts" such as the strutting "Sassy Me".
                <br>
                <br>Caitlin Kelley of Forbes remarked that "As a whole, "RBB" is like if cocktail music became anthemic pop and then soundtracked a horror movie.
                 The harmonies are complex, and vocal ad libs fill every nook and cranny of empty space". She also talked about the rest of the album and stated that "Red Velvet has a reputation for never skimping on their B-sides", asserting that "All of the songs on the six-track RBB EP are strong enough to stand on their own" and called "Sassy Me" the standout track from the album, saying it's a "self-empowerment anthem" that imbues the group's "flair for experimentalism".
                  Crystal Bell of MTV commented that "On first listen, "RBB (Really Bad Boy)" is a song that really shouldn't work. It's a cacophony of sounds, rhythms, shrill ad-libs, complex harmonies, and a whole lot of brass". For a lead single, it's unapologetically bold and loud — the kind of song that beats you into submission with a powerful "oh my God" straight to your temporal lobes — but that's what makes it so unabashedly Red Velvet".
                   She then concluded that with the group's "distinct vocal charms and tight harmonies, no two Red Velvet songs sound the same — and while "RBB" may be a divisive entry in the group's discography, you can't say it isn't 100 percent them".

However, in South Korea, Kim Sang-hwa of OhmyStar said the song received mixed reactions from the public but claimed that for those who follow the group and their music, this is normal for a Red Velvet release, that unpredictability is common for their title tracks and "RBB (Really Bad Boy)" is no exception. They added further that they're "controversial" because they're "unfamiliar", stating that they're welcome to those who are seeking something new.

The album ranked fifth on Idolator's '10 Best K-Pop Albums Of 2018' list.
